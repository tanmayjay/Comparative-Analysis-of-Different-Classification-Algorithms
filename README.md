# Comparative-Analysis-of-Different-Classification-Algorithms
This project aims at implementing different machine learning classification algorithms on a selected dataset and analyzing the results in terms of comparison among the performance of those algorithms. After selecting a dataset, four classifications algorithm namely Decision Tree Induction, Random Forest Classifier, Na√Øve Bayes Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier were implemented to predict the class level. After implantation, the report containing accuracy has been generated for all the algorithm. In addition, confusion matrix, and ROC graph has been visualized. All the process has been done using both Weka tool and different Python libraries in Jupyter Notebook.
